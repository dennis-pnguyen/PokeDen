# PokéDen

A dynamic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript solo front-end project.
A web application for Pokémon enthusiasts who want to view their favorite monsters.

## The Why?

As someone who grew up with Pokémon as it was being introduced to America, this franchise has always held a special place in my life. Whether it was watching the anime, collecting trading cards, or playing through the video games, Pokémon offers a robust experience for individuals across all ages. This project was built with that in mind where anyone could view their favorite monsters and their corresponding information. It was also my first solo project as a developer who was new into the world of web development!
